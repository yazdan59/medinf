# Medical Informatics
## Overview
Medical Informatics tries to combine different types of information with computer-aided systems. In summary, it deals with resources, devices, and methods required to optimize acquisition, storage, retrieval, and use of information in health and biomedicine. Since this is a major field of study and could not be covered through a course, we just rely on studying the useful resources related to Medical Biotechnology. We also introduce some important scientific concepts every scientist should know in 21st century.
